TOP calculator
------------------------
Issues with styling:
- Styling the buttons in symmetry with the purple buttons
- Was suprised(?) that the button numbers start from 789 456 etc and not 123 456 etc. Overthought how I should have moved the buttons
- The shape of the buttons

Issues with script.js:
- Wanted to implement it like casio calculators with the equation on the top left and the results on the bottom right but was easier to implement akin to modern calculators
- Displaying the chosen numbers
- Previous num display shifted to the middle of the screen instead of staying at the top when current num display was empty
- Saving both numbers to be used in the equation
